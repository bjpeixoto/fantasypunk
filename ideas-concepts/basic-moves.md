When you make a move, you express *intentions*.

The point is that you go for an action and that action caries an intent.

Sttronger hits allow your intention and action too go in tandem.

But weaker hits offer you a bargan between success and completeness, orr speed etc, or your intention not being misread, misjudged misplaced etc, bring you more trouble.

Options for working the concept later:

- you raise suspicion
- you ttract unwanted attention
- you place someone in harm's way
- you place someone in trouble
- you reveal yourself
- your intentions are not what they seem
- you betray a sort of "selfish" interest

## Be Kind

**When you are kind**, ask the GM or another player what their character, a place or another entity needs. Describe how you intend to fulfil that need, then roll Kind.

On a critical hit, choose none. On a solid hit choose one. On a messy hit, choose 2.

- results: they comes as a cost, are incomplete or faulty, or you get the barest clue about how to move forward;
- actions: your actions are offensive to a culture, custom, rules or laws, if not outright harmful;
- intentions: someone beccomes suspicious or distrustful of you, or will not cooperate without a show of good faith;

Results, Actions, Intentions.
- heal, treat, aid;
- relate, empathize, inspire, support;
- sway, disarm, placate.

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome;

On a miss, **brace yourself**.

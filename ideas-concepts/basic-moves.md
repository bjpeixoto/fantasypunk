When you make a move, you express *intentions*.

The point is that you go for an action and that action caries an intent.

Sttronger hits allow your intention and action too go in tandem.

But weaker hits offer you a bargan between success and completeness, orr speed etc, or your intention not being misread, misjudged misplaced etc, bring you more trouble.

Options for working the concept later:

- you raise suspicion
- you ttract unwanted attention
- you place someone in harm's way
- you place someone in trouble
- you reveal yourself
- your intentions are not what they seem
- you betray a sort of "selfish" interest

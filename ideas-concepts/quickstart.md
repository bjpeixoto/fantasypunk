Quick start rules

# The Setup

Gather a group of 4 to 6 players, including you, that are interested or curious about fantasy, post fantasy, scientific fantasy or something like that.

Choose one of you to play as the Giramundo, or GM, while the others play as Party Companions, or PCs.

The PCs don't need to know a lot about this game or roleplaying games at all, but the GM is more likely to run a smooth and engaging game if they have some previous experience in running or playing narrative games.

You will need six-sided dice (d6), writing materials, and the basic rules for this game as a reference. It doesn't matter if all or any of the above are physical or digital. You can run this game with a single d6, but having a bunch available is easier and more fun.

Schedule about 2 or 3 hours to play together, plus a bit of extra time to talk about how you wish to play the game, to have breaks when necessary, and to talk about the game after you finish.

Find or create a safe, welcoming, comfortable space where everyone can have enough freedom, intimacy, and support as possible to express yourselves.

Agree on what safety tools you wish to employ to help you all navigate tricky or uncomfortable situations that may emerge from play.

# How to Play

**Follow these steps to prepare the game:**

1. Take turns reading the player principles;
2. Choose an existing setting or create one together or roll 1d6 on the table below:
 
    |1d6|Thread|
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | Sol |
    | 2 | Many Moons |
    | 3 | We, The Monsters |
    | 4 | Everything is Good |
    | 5 | Stonetouched |
    | 6 | A Rock and a Hard Place |

3. Create a PC for each player;

**Follow these steps to run the game:**

4. The GM describes a tricky, dangerous, or otherwise charged situation by describing the place and people the PCs are met with;
5. The players describe how the PCs engage the situation presented;
6. The GM may prompt the PCs with questions to further clarify the scene while the PCs may do the same to each other and the GM;
7. The GM may prompt the PCs to make a move, or the PCs may offer to do so;
8. Once the move is resolved, the GM will describe how the scene changed, introduce a new character, called NPC, and so on. 
9. The PCs will collaborate in that development according to the result of the move, or whenever they feel like it, to everyone's agreement.
10. Return to step x if the themes and objectives of the scene haven't been fully explored, or the GM will introduce the characters t a new scene, and go back to step Y.

**Ending the game:**

11. When the time for play is up or everyone agrees the game should end, end it and decide whether you wish to continue this Tale, or move on to another Tale or another game.

# The Pillars of Play

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around the you;
- Folk are complicated, conflicted and diverse, but are mostly kind and willing to help;
- Most people, including you, is fundamentally good, even if conflicted, troubled or reluctant;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- The gods are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals;
- No individuals, folk or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being, usually by choice or complacency.

## Agenda

- Play characters that feel real;
- Stir up trouble;
- Disrupt the status quo;
- Play to **Find Out What Happens**.

## Principles

- Be bold and embrace the fantastic;
- Make your character fallible and relatable;
- Give your characters something to believe in;
- Address the party, not the players;
- Remind us of your moves;
- Take risks and embrace the consequences;
- Always ask questions. Always answer questions;
- Help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

# Scenarios and Settings

Decide on a setting or scenario you all would like to explore.

You can use a world from a popular movie or book, choose a setting written for games like this, or come up with your own. Maybe all of those together, and if you want, the whole group can participate in coming up with a world that is interesting, mysterious, and full of opportunities.

Alternatively, you can use the micro-settings and scenarios described below. Choose one of them or roll 1d6 to let the die choose for you.

1. **Sol** - The world is incredibly old, and civilizations rose and fell so many times few dare keep track. The Old World left Relics powered by the Sun, which no one can recreate and few can figure out what they are for, often settling on repurposing them. Sol is a Post-Fantasy setting of high magic and mystical technology both ubiquitous and mysterious;

2. **Many Moons** - It is said that less than a century ago, the Last Day set, the sky lit up with crimson and gold, the stars burned and then many Moons rose from the core of the planet to light the path to freedom. They criss-cross the sky, bathing us with eternal twilight, ever-shifting the Tides, which we learned to Sail to build our lives within the crystal domes that now bejewel the world.

3. **We, the Monsters** - When the Spheres converged, Humans poured into our world, hell-bent on conquering, colonizing, and annihilating everything they didn't own or understand. They call our homes lairs, our communities hordes, and us they call monsters. They have destroyed or stolen too much, yet it is not enough. But we, the Monsters, will hold our ground and push back, and they will be sorry they ever set foot in our world.

4. **Everything is Good** - There is a village between the River and the Mountain, embraced by the Woods. In this quiet, peaceful village, the Elders keep the Community organized, while the folk toil and idle happily. Every day is the same, everyone is content and everything is in place. And it's all wrong. All of you are blow-ins, but none of you remember where you arrived from, who you were before or why you are here. And this realization hits you like a hammer as all of you wake up somewhere deep in the woods, by a white obelisk, and there are a bunch of dead people lying around you.

5. **Stonetouched** - When the children of Lua come of age, they gather around the Stones, a set of rocks that sprout from the ground in a semi-circular formation. They sing and dance, and the stones hum in harmony with their chant. During the ritual, each youth vibes with one of the Stones, receiving one of the aspects of the moonfolk: 
    - From the Black Stone, the form of the Moon, Enluara. 
    - From the Myriad stone, the form of the Dream, Quimera. 
    - From the Coral Stone,the form of the Fire, Valente. 
    - From the Nightstone, the form of the Star, Celeste. 
    - From the Clearstone, the form of the Light, Lumiar. 
    
    Usually, three to five youths participate in the ceremony together. Once they receive their blessings, they are to be sent out in the world as a party and journey through it to become wiser.

6. **A Rock and a Hard Place** - A Runaway Princess, a Stargazer, a Knight of the Moon and Star, and a Petty Criminal find themselves beset by a band of mercenaries led by The Hound on one flank, while the gates of the Devil's Keep looms on the other. This day started badly when you lost the ship to sail past the Misty Sea towards the Rou homeland, and now this. How did you end up in this situation, and, more importantly, how will you get the heck out of it?

# 3. Introduce the Cast

Follow these steps to create your PC. You can skip any step if you feel stuck and come back to them later as you get more ideas from the other players and from the things you come up with.

1. To create a PC, choose their name, determine their pronouns, and choose a Background.
2. Each character has 5 Traits: Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful, and Insightful. Choose one of those to be Striving, and another to be Struggling.
3. Choose a unique trait from their Background.
4. Each PC carries some Baggage, 5 items that represent their most relevant possessions, skills, abilities, or lessons learned. Take the items offered from your Background and interpret them however it makes sense for your character.
5. Choose 1 Special Move to complete your character.
6. Circle back to revise the character you put together and change anything you need as appropriate.

# Making Moves 

Sometimes you will approach the Tale in ways that involve taking a risk or raising the stakes.

That's when Moves come in, changing the direction of the Tale, often in somewhat unpredictable ways.

Most moves require that you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful, or Insightful.

When you make a move, describe what you are doing and how, and figure which Trait best applies to your approach.

Roll the dice as established and interpret the results together with the GM and the other PCs.

# Rolling Dice

When a move prompts you to roll dice, roll a dice pool and add together the highest two results.

A +1 Forward and a +1 Ongoing add 1d6 each and don't stack;

# Backgrounds

## The Witch

You are taught and practiced in the ancient traditions that seek understanding of the Old Powers mysterious to the mundane senses.

**Unique Trait** (choose one or roll 1d6): reserved, cryptical, parental, joyous, respectful, rebellious.

**Baggage:** a CONDUIT for your practice; a SOURCE OF WISDOM; a PAINFUL LESSON; two other things.

## The Contender

Your element is confrontation, whether it is to guard and protect, to seize and overcome, or to resist and survive.

**Unique trait** (choose one or roll 1d6): disciplined, nimble, tough, cunning, callous, indomitable.

**Baggage:** a WEAPON or your BARE HANDS; something UNBREAKABLE; something VULNERABLE; two other things.

## The Privileged

Protected by class, status, wealth, or otherwise people and institutions of power, you have had the privilege of enjoying more in the way of contacts, favours, politics, elites and so on, functionally alienating you from the daily struggles of others.

Now you seek the outside world for sport, yearning or by being driven out from comfort.

**Unique Trait** (choose one or roll 1d6): Haughty, Gullible, Proud, Innocent, Extravagant, Spoiled.

**Baggage:** a PURSE OF VALUABLES; FAVOURS TO COLLECT; INSIDER KNOWLEDGE; two other things.

## The Marginal

Your conversation with the laws and common customs in most places is one-way only. 

Carving out a living through means that are at best frowned upon sees you at the fringes of social acceptance, if you ever had any to beging with, which might be how you ended up here in the first place.

**Unique Trait** (choose one or roll 1d6): Alert, Irreverent, Cunning, Sardonic, Ambitious, Optimistic.

**Baggage:** an ILEGAL TOOL; a HIDDEN WEAPON; a CLEVER ESCAPE; two other things.

- They get 1 XP;

### Slay

When you take decisive and direct action to put an opponent down with words or deeds, erase a burden and instantly kill them or shut them down.

When you’re backed in a corner, be Brave. On a sound hit, choose 1:

- You have an unexpected ally. Ask the GM who it is.
- You have a desperate opportunity. Ask the GM what it is.
- You have a sudden realization. Ask or tell the GM what it is.
- You find reserves of speed, strength, or endurance. Tell the GM what you can do.

On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 for you. On a miss, you are good and cornered. Brace yourself.

### Invoke the Old Powers

When you invoke the Old Powers, consider what is the effect you desire and ask the table what price is to be paid for invoking such powers, then roll Insightful.

On a sound hit, you get 2 tokens. On a messy hit, you get 1. Spend tokens, one for one, on the following options:

- the effect you desire comes to pass;
- you retain control;
- you avoid paying nature’s price.



### Shape Change

**Scatter track: ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐**

You can transform into an animal that you have studied extensively, and back again. While in this form, your inventory is a list of that animal's natural features.

Choose two tags for that animal, replacing your own personal tags while you're in its shape.

Scatter: When you spend long periods of time in animal shape, or when you endure stress, exhaustion or harm, you start to forget how much of you is you and how much of you is the animal, until you forget completely.

- Gain 1 scatter when you spend a whole shift in animal form;
- Gain 1 scatter when you take a serious Blow;
- Gain 1 scatter when you lose all Hold on a burden;
- Gain 1 scatter when you erase a burden.

At 3 scatter you need help to regain your true form. At 5 scatter you become an animal and even if you are turned back by someone powerful enough to revert your condition, it changes you. Erase one of your personal tags and replace it with another.

### Stealth

When you avoid mundane scrutiny, roll Precise.

On a hit, you start a clock. You may remain unnoticed until you tick all of the sections of that clock. On a critical hit, you start a 6 clock. On a sound hit, you start a 4 clock. On a messy hit, you start a 4 clock and must pick one of these options:

- You use your party as a distraction and remain free to move and act unnoticed;
- You may act and remain unnoticed only as long as you stay where you are;
- You can move unnoticed only as long as you do nothing;
- The clock is hidden from you.

You can clear two segments of the clock by picking a new option from above.

You can tick more segments of the clock to gain certain benefits:

- 2 ticks to aggravate a blow you inflict;
- 1 tick to give +1d6 to a party member;
- 2 ticks to add +1 to your initiative (when using the Confront a Foe move);
- 2 ticks to give yourself +1d6;
- 5 ticks to use the slay move, even if you don't have it;
- 1 to misdirect someone's attention.

On a miss, brace yourself.

When you roll the dice, you can spend 1 Hold to re-roll all dice that rolled a number equal or lower than this move's level.

ideas from https://afurness.itch.io/move-mondays-2022

Birdwatcher

When you hide in plain sight to gather information, roll.

On a 12+, tell the GM one piece of information you have learned. They must incorporate it, and you create an advantage in a future scene.

On a 10+, you observe something important. The GM will tell you what it is.

On a 7-9, you observe something important, but you are compromised. The GM tells you what you learn, and you create a disadvantage in a future scene.

On a 6-, you are caught. You must retire this character.

Forbidden Knowledge

When you use your innate connection to the cosmos to gain insight into a situation, roll.

On a 10+ choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1. The GM must answer honestly.

What about this do I see that no one else has noticed?
What evidence is there that a supernatural element is at play?
What essential truth about this situation is being obscured?

Unleash the Beast

Once per session, you may choose to transform into the beast inside you. Describe what that looks like. Roll.
On a 10+, you transform as intended and maintain full control of the beast. You create an advantage for yourself. Choose two:

temporarily increase one stat
take advantage on your next roll
ask the GM a question that they must answer honestly
On a 7-9, you only partially transform. Describe how you are half-person, half-beast. Name one benefit you have from this half-transformation. The GM will give you a complication.

On a 6-, you fully transform, but do not have control of the beast. Narrate how you make the situation worse.

Let the Right One In

When you share your true monstrous nature with someone, tell them a fundamental truth about yourself. If you do, you may choose one:

Clear a complication or condition
Gain a useful resource. The GM tells you what it is.
State a fact about the situation that you know to be true. The GM must incorporate this fact. This fact cannot definitely solve or end the primary story/mystery/question.

Practical Magic

When you use magic to assist with a mundane task, roll.

On a 10+, you succeed.

On a 7-9, you succeed but your magic is spent. The GM will tell you when you can use your magic again.

On a 6-, something goes terribly wrong. Ask another player what happens.

Quarrels over Quills

When you try to solve a problem by arguing, name what you hope to accomplish. The GM will tell you what happens if you fail. If you wish to proceed, roll.

On a 10+ you succeed. The person you are arguing with will fulfill one request, provided it does not cause harm to themselves or another person.

On a 7-9, you succeed, but the person you were arguing with now has a vendetta against you.

---

---

# Challenges

Sometimes a complication escalates beyond a simple approach, or at other times, things start hot right out of the gate. That's when the PCs may face a Challenge.

## Creating a Challenge

To create a Challenge, name it after what the PCs are trying to move towards (Escape Captivity, Find the Secret Entrance to the Keep, Meet with the Baroness), or what is antagonizing them (Greedy Dragon, Angry Mob, Doctor Desmond, The Guardian Magic).

Then write in two to five Aspects. Aspects represent how Challenges defy the PCs, and what specific obstacles they must engage in to overcome the Challenge.

Aspects should be concise, no longer than two or three words.

When the GM must make a move in reaction to the PCs on the behalf of a Challenge, usually it's by describing it as an Aspect expressing itself.
    

## Overcoming Challenges

Overcoming a Challenge doesn't mean necessarily overcoming each and all of its Angles, as the fiction changes every time the party overcomes an Angle.

Some Challenges might be overcome by defeating only some of its Angles.

Maybe by pursuing complete defeat of the Challenge, the party might earn a greater benefit, while the overall cost is very likely to be higher as a downside.

---

# The Giramundo

As the GM, you are a kind of host, facilitator, and counterpoint to the other Players. Your main job is to help provoke dramatic situations for the PCs and be able to introduce others to the rules. 

It’s okay to learn as you go, too. The core of the game is mostly in the basic and special moves.

## Agenda

The agenda is a set of guidelines you should try to accomplish as a GM.

- Play to find out what happens;
- Sprinkle the wondrous in the mundane, and vice-versa;
- Make the world full of colourful and diverse people.

## Always say

- What the principles demand (as follow);
- What the rules demand;
- What your prep demands;
- What honesty demands.

## Principles

These few simple principles will help you tell enjoyable and compelling stories with the other players.

- Talk to the Characters, not the Players;
- Change the World;
- Change the Characters;
- Favour Opportunities over Outcomes;
- Embrace the fantastic;
- Leave Blank Spaces;
- Be a Fan of the Players AND the Characters.

## GM Moves

- Make Their Baggage Heavier;
- Give Them a Choice;
- Plant a Seed;
- Take Something Away;
- Show How the Community Feels;
- Ask a Question;
- Random Encounter;
- Give Them What They Want;
- Say “But...”.

# The First Scene

Once all of the PCs are ready, it's time for the GM to introduce them to the first scene.

From here on, the PCs don't need to continue reading. We assume that the player who takes the role of the GM is reading this.

Start by coming up with an interesting situation that immediately places the PCs front and center.

Maybe they are taking part in a chase, front, back, or both! Alternatively, they could have been cornered by someone, literally or not.

Some of the most engaging charged situations involve one or more of the PCs personally and intimately - a close friend in trouble, a request by an ally, a personal enemy facing them, and so on. The more PCs get wrapped up from the beginning, the better.

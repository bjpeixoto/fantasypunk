Children of Ava

Ava made aer children from the sea foam, gently shoring them to form all sorts of beasts and the Aepekin, folk who descend from ancient beasts who learned thought, reason and culture.

Aepekin, as all other children of Ava, respond to the cycles of the moons, which inuence their bodies, moods and magic.

Body of the Moon: the cycles of your body are attuned to the cycles of the moon, allowing you to change a Highlighted or a Suppressed trait at the start of the session.

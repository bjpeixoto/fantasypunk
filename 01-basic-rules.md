small explanations (for now)

## Traits

The essential approaches to exploring the world. They give you dice to add to the pool. Choose a Highlighted trait and a Suppressed Trait.

Highlighted Trait: 2d6

Suppressed Trait: 0d6

The others: 1d6

## Baggage

Your personal, individual set of items, values, assets and skills. You can have 5 items.

When you start the game, determine what those items are: something you wield, wear, fear, seek and hide.

Hold: Each item in your baggage starts with 0 Weight.

When you rely on your baggage, add 1 Weight to the item you relied on.

When any item accumulates 3 Weight, it becomes a Burden, and you can't rely on it for the time being.

When all items in your Baggage become Burdens, you become Overwhelmed.

## Moves

Most of the core procedures of the game fall into this category. Each move is a small block of rules that apply to a specific situation. When you trigger a move, follow its instructions.

## Debts

A form of bond with an entity that must be repaid somehow. When a debt grows too large, that entity will find a way to collect.

## Obligations

Promises, duties or quests you must fulfil for a variety of reasons, from avoiding or clearing debts, to earning a break or gaining someone’s favour.

## Origin

The life you had before you ended up as an adventurer. The GM will rely on your origin to fill the world with relevant details, and you can leverage your Origin to have the GM give you valuable information.

## Heritage

Abilities and gifts from your blood or history. Heritage allows you to explore the world in unique ways, even being able to make moves at time you otherwise wouldn’t. Sometimes your Heritage can help or hinder you more directly.

## Move Inspo

VENTURE OUT - one shot world

When you venture out, decide who will be the guide. Answer the questions below and **Trust Fate**. You get +1d6 for every question you answer yes to.

Do you have a map?

Have you travelled around this area before?

Do you have a set objective?

Then, indicate the route you‚Äôd

like to take and, if appropriate, a destination.

Then, the guide rolls+WIS. On a 10+ you arrive just fine, and they describe the most memorable part of the journey. On a 7-9, you survive the journey, but choose two:

Someone or something has followed you to your destination, ask the GM what it is.

Roll 1d4+1; the party as a whole must discard that many uses of equipment or pieces or gear. For each piece discarded, ask that player how it got lost or used up.

It‚Äôs been a slog. it took longer than you expected and you‚Äôre all minus 1

ongoing until you Settle In.

On a miss, your trip is interrupted part way

by a danger, crisis, or hazard. Ask the GM to

tell you what it is.

SETTLE IN

When you settle in to rest, decide on a

watch order with your allies. Then, answer

the following:

¬ç Did we learn something new and

important about the world?

¬ç Did we overcome a notable monster or

enemy?

¬ç Did we loot a memorable treasure?

For any ‚Äúyes‚Äù answer, mark 1 XP. Finally,

when you wake after a good night‚Äôs sleep,

heal an amount of HP equal to half of your

maximum.

Recover

When you do nothing but rest in comfort

and safety...

¬ç After a day of rest you recover all your

HP.

¬ç After three days of rest you remove one

debility of your choice.

¬ç If you‚Äôre under the care of a healer

(magical or otherwise) you heal a

debility for every two days of rest

instead.

LAST BREATH

When you‚Äôre dying, you catch a glimpse of

what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death‚Äôs

Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then

roll+nothing.

¬ç On a 10+, you‚Äôve cheated Death‚Äîyou‚Äôre

in a bad spot but you‚Äôre still alive.

¬ç On a 7-9, Death himself will offer you a

bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse

and pass beyond the Black Gates into

whatever fate awaits you.

¬ç On 6-, your fate is sealed. You‚Äôre

marked as Death‚Äôs own and you‚Äôll cross

the threshold soon. The GM will tell

you when

GATHER INFORMATION - Ironsworn

When you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation, or

follow a track, roll +wits. If you act within a community or ask questions

of a person with whom you share a bond, add +1.

On a strong hit, you discover something helpful and specific. The path

you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made

clear. Envision what you learn (Ask the Oracle if unsure), and take +2

momentum.

On a weak hit, the information complicates your quest or introduces a

new danger. Envision what you discover (Ask the Oracle if unsure), and

take +1 momentum.

On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an

unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. Pay the Price.

HEAL

When you treat an injury or ailment, roll +wits. If you are mending your

own wounds, roll +wits or +iron, whichever is lower.

On a strong hit, your care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care)

have the wounded condition, you may clear it. Then, take or give up to +2

health.

On a weak hit, as above, but you must suffer -1 supply or -1 momentum

(your choice).

On a miss, your aid is ineffective. Pay the Price.

MAKE CAMP

When you rest and recover for several hours in the wild, roll +supply.

On a strong hit, you and your allies may each choose two. On a weak hit,

choose one.

- Recuperate: Take +1 health for you and any companions.
- Partake: Suffer -1 supply and take +1 health for you and any

companions.

- Relax: Take +1 spirit.
- Focus: Take +1 momentum.
- Prepare: When you break camp, add +1 if you Undertake a Journey.

On a miss, you take no comfort. Pay the Price.

UNDERTAKE A JOURNEY

When you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar lands, set the rank of

your journey.

- Troublesome journey: 3 progress per waypoint.
- Dangerous journey: 2 progress per waypoint.
- Formidable journey: 1 progress per waypoint.
- Extreme journey: 2 ticks per waypoint.
- Epic journey: 1 tick per waypoint.

Then, for each segment of your journey, roll +wits. If you are setting off

from a community with which you share a bond, add +1 to your initial

roll.

On a strong hit, you reach a waypoint. If the waypoint is unknown to

you, envision it (Ask the Oracle if unsure). Then, choose one.

- You make good use of your resources: Mark progress.
- You move at speed: Mark progress and take +1 momentum, but

suffer -1 supply.

On a weak hit, you reach a waypoint and mark progress, but suffer -1

supply.

On a miss, you are waylaid by a perilous event. Pay the Price.

REACH YOUR DESTINATION

Progress Move

When your journey comes to an end, roll the challenge dice and

compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a strong hit, the situation at your destination favors you. Choose one.

- Make another move now (not a progress move), and add +1.
- Take +1 momentum.

On a weak hit, you arrive but face an unforeseen hazard or complication.

Envision what you find (Ask the Oracle if unsure).

On a miss, you have gone hopelessly astray, your objective is lost to you,

or you were misled about your destination. If your journey continues,

clear all but one filled progress, and raise the journey‚Äôs rank by one (if not

already epic).

SOJOURN

When you spend time in a community seeking assistance, roll +heart. If

you share a bond, add +1.

On strong hit, you and your allies may each choose two from within the

categories below. On a weak hit, choose one. If you share a bond, choose

one more.

On a hit, you and your allies may each focus on one of your chosen

recover actions and roll +heart again. If you share a bond, add +1. On a

dice.

progress track, and choose one.

is (Ask the Oracle if unsure), do it (or Swear an Iron Vow), and mark the

bond. If you refuse or fail, Pay the Price.

On a miss, they reject you. Pay the Price.

TEST YOUR BOND

When your bond is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance,

roll +heart.

On a strong hit, this test has strengthened your bond. Choose one.

- Take +1 spirit.
- Take +2 momentum.

On a weak hit, your bond is fragile and you must prove your loyalty.

Envision what they ask of you (Ask the Oracle if unsure), and do it (or

Swear an Iron Vow). If you refuse or fail, clear the bond and Pay the Price.

On a miss, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship,

clear the bond and Pay the Price.

AID YOUR ALLY

When you Secure an Advantage in direct support of an ally, and score

a hit, they (instead of you) can take the benefits of the move. If you are in

combat and score a strong hit, you and your ally have initiative.

WRITE YOUR EPILOGUE

Progress Move

When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, envision two things: What

you hope for, and what you fear. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare

to your bonds. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a strong hit, things come to pass as you hoped.

On a weak hit, your life takes an unexpected turn, but not necessarily for

the worse. You find yourself spending your days with someone or in a

place you did not foresee. Envision it (Ask the Oracle if unsure).

On a miss, your fears are realized.

PAY THE PRICE

When you suffer the outcome of a move, choose one.

- Make the most obvious negative outcome happen.
- Envision two negative outcomes. Rate one as ‚Äòlikely‚Äô, and Ask the

Oracle using the yes/no table. On a ‚Äòyes‚Äô, make that outcome happen.

Otherwise, make it the other.

- Roll on the following table. If you have difficulty interpreting the

result to fit the current situation, roll again.

Roll Result

1-2 Roll again and apply that result but make it worse. If you

roll this result yet again, think of something dreadful that

changes the course of your quest (Ask the Oracle if unsure)

and make it happen.

3-5 A person or community you trusted loses faith in you, or

acts against you.

6-9 A person or community you care about is exposed to danger.

10-16 You are separated from something or someone.

17-23 Your action has an unintended effect.

24-32 Something of value is lost or destroyed.

33-41 The current situation worsens.

42-50 A new danger or foe is revealed.

51-59 It causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.

60-68 It is harmful.

69-76 It is stressful.

77-85 A surprising development complicates your quest.

86-90 It wastes resources.

91-94 It forces you to act against your best intentions.

95-98 A friend, companion, or ally is put in harm‚Äôs way (or you are,

if alone).

99-00 Roll twice more on this table. Both results occur. If they are

the same result, make it worse.

ASK THE ORACLE

When you seek to resolve questions, discover details in the world,

determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or

events, you may...

- Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting

and obvious result.

- Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a ‚Äòyes‚Äô, and roll on the table

below to check the answer.

- Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as ‚Äòlikely‚Äô, and roll on the

table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

- Spark an idea: Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

Odds The answer is ‚Äòyes‚Äô if you roll...

Almost Certain 11 or greater

Likely 26 or greater

50/50 51 or greater

Unlikely 76 or greater

Small Chance 91 or greater

On a match, an extreme result or twist has occurred.

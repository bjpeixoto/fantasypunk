# Basic Moves

These moves are available to all party members at all times.

# Expression Moves

> 📍 Currently this section of the text assumes that you have more familiarity with TTRPGs than other parts of the game.

When you express your thoughts, feelings and actions, most of the time you do that through an expression move.

When you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, take 1d6. If you express a trait that is Highlighted, take 2d6 instead. If that trait is suppressed, take 1d6 instead.

You can only roll for a move if you have at least 2d6. So if you need more dice, you might need to rely on your Baggage or Push Your Luck.

When a specialized move asks you to be Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, roll as many d6 as established and continue following that move’s instructions.

Expression Moves are open-ended, which means you must decide what you wish to do and how you approach that choice. Discuss with the GM and the rest of the Party whether you wish to interact with the world fictionally, mechanically or both, and then roll.

> Tip - Mechanics you could interact with: a clock, an angle, a burden, an obligation, a debt, the dice.

### When should you make these moves?

Expression moves cover a very wide array of actions, so it is tempting to make these moves and roll the dice every time.

On the other hand, there’s plenty that your characters should know or be able to do as second nature, without even thinking about it.

When you need to make an Expression Move, discuss with the party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true.

- I have enought practice or experience at this I don't need to think about it.
- I have time and freedom to do it leisurely.
- I am empowered or supplied by the knowledge and tools necessary.

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll. Discuss with the GM and your party members how you do the thing you want to.

If two statements are true, take +1d6 forward.

If one statement is true, make your move and roll the dice as usual.

If none of these statements are true, discuss with the group whether you should be able to make that move at all.

# Exploration Moves

When travelling through the world, you enter the Exploration phase. You can use these moves when exploring.

## Prepare

When you prepare for the journey ahead, be Mindful.

## Set Out

When you set out into the wilds, ask each party member for 1 hope they have for the road ahead and 1 fear. Also, answer these 3 questions:

- Is the group stocked up?
- Is the group free of duress or any injury that may inhibit their journey?
- Has the group eluded dangerous attention in the area?

One party member rolls 1d6 for every time the group could answer yes to the above questions.

On a solid hit, the GM chooses 2 hopes to be realized along the way. On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 hope and 1 fear to be realized. On a miss, The GM chooses 2 fears to be realized, this is going to be a long journey.

## Roam

When the party **roams** the world without a specific goal or destiny, roll 2d6. Use the lowest die to pick a Theme and the other to pick a Domain, then do it a second time to pick a second Theme and a second Domain.

## Arrive

When you arrive at a new location, choose 2 Themes for that location and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain.

If that place is a landmark, settlement or otherwise remarkable place, you may name it.

## Delve

When you guide the party through a dangerous or unfamiliar place, roll Curious.

On a hit, gain 1 token. On a sound hit choose 2 from below. On a messy hit choose 1:

- This area contains something valuable or useful;
- This area’s residents are not immediately hostile;
- You find a clue to the true nature of this place or an important insight about its denizens.

Spend 1 token to Return to an area you’ve visited before Spend 3 tokens to find the heart of the area, or locate someone or something you are attempting to track down.

idea: the area tells history (maybe myriad hex tyle?)

## Catch your Breath

When you **catch your breath** during exploration, each party member describes 1 risk of resting here.

You get as many tokens as the dice you rolled.

Any party member can spend these tokens to do the following:

- Let go of 3 Weight;
- Recover a spent Heritage Tag use.

For this move, lower results are more desirable.

On a result of 1 to 3, your rest is uneventful.

On a roll of 4 or 5, the GM chooses a risk and it comes to pass.

On a roll of 6, the GM chooses two risks to come to pass.

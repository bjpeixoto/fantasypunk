# Playing Safe Games

When you play **fantasypunk**, or any other game, remember to be kind to yourself and to the other players. Use these tools or any others you like to ensure a safer game for everyone.

Provided below is a small guide of safety tools that you can use in your games. 

It’s important that any gaming group discusses what safety tools everyone feels most comfortable with and how to apply them to the game.

You may find even more related to safety tools [here](https://itch.io/c/1655621/safety-tools-and-wellbeing-for-ttrpg).

## Before Play

### [CATS](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/12/CATS.html), by

This is a tool to make sure everyone has a say in what kind of adventures they want to play and to determine whether this game or adventure really is for you or if you should play something else, or join a different group. It has four prompts:

### Concept

At a high level, what’s this game about? Are there conditions for success? What kind of adventure can we have with it? Are the rules lighter or deeper?

### Aim

Discuss what kind of stories you would like to tell. What would we like to accomplish? How much social interaction, exploration, drama, or action would we like to have?

### Tone

Find consensus about what kind of game everyone wants to have: Is the atmosphere more light-hearted, humorous, dramatic, intense? A combination of those?

### Subject Matter

What ideas do we want to explore during gameplay? Do they make anyone uncomfortable? Discuss what boundaries need to be set if any, and how to handle triggers, uncomfortable subjects and safety at the game.

## During Play

### Journeying Tools from [Wanderhome, by Jay Dragon](https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/wanderhome)

These are a few prompts and questions players can use during their adventure.

“Let’s do this instead.”

When the chosen course of action is making someone uncomfortable, choose a different one.

“Do we want to?”

When you’re not sure everyone is on board with the chosen course of action you chose, this is a way to express that you’d like everyone to buy in.

“Where to next?”

If you feel the adventure came to a standstill or that you are stuck, you can discuss what to do to move the adventure forward.

“What do you think?”

Sometimes we need a bit of extra time to think, focus or express ourselves. If someone seems quieter or seems to be speaking less, you can ask them what they think and check how they are feeling.

“Hold on.”

Sometimes we need a break for some water and self-care, or because something happened that is making us uncomfortable and we want to tackle it, or because we want to look back at something from earlier.

“No.”

You shouldn’t do something you don’t want to. If you feel you need to change something to fit your needs or to have agency over your character or the world around you.

Step away

The base assumption is that the game is being productive and that issues and problems can be navigated safely through conversation. If that’s not the case you can leave at any moment.

## After Play

### [Stars and Wishes](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes), from The Gauntlet

At the conclusion of a game session everyone who played, including the facilitator, offers a Star to another player, to a moment in the game, or to an element of the overall experience (you can give out more stars if you have time). You can award a star for - amazing roleplay, great character moments, amazing descriptions by the GM, the feeling you had at a certain moment, another player’s generosity, a mechanic of the game system that really sang etc. A star is a thing you loved about the game - if the game you played was amazing it is often hard to choose!

After stars have been given, everyone makes a Wish. Each player tells the table something they would like to see happen in a future session. You can make a wish about: something you want to see happen with your own character, an interaction you’d love to see between two characters, a mechanic you would like to see come into play that you haven’t seen yet, places you hope the story might go, etc.

## Debrief

### [EARS](https://blackarmada.com/tools-to-use-after-play/), from The Gauntlet

This is a structured way for everyone to talk about the game you just played, and to learn about how everyone is feeling, as well as giving yourself the opportunity to relax and come out of character. It has four prompts.

### Explain

Discuss what the debrief will cover. (I suggest including: talking about everything that happened, discussing any highlights, addressing any challenging issues that came up in play, talking about how it made us feel, talking about anything we learned.) It’s possible this is going to be mostly enthusiastic reminiscing, but it could be that someone has had a bad time and wants to talk about it. So, encourage everyone to be ready to listen supportively.

### Agenda

Give everyone the opportunity to name one thing they’d like to talk about, and briefly say why (no big deal if it turns out to be two things, and no big deal if some people don’t have anything they want to talk about.)

### Reflect

Let each person talk through their one thing in their own words, without interruption. What moment(s) from the game are they speaking to? Was there anything specific they wanted to address in the discussion? Why did they want to focus on this?

### Support

Everyone else is free to respond but in a supportive way. If you don’t agree with what they said, that’s fine, but try not to make it personal, or make them feel like their opinion isn’t valid. Even if you don’t agree, make sure you listen and try to think about what you can learn from this. Ask clarifying questions and provide your own thoughts and reflections.

## Conclusion

You may find these and safety tools more in this [List of Safety Tools](https://gabrielcaetano.itch.io/safety-tools-and-wellbeing-a-curated-list). Feel free to adapt these to your group and your game needs.

# fantasypunk

Let’s get playing this game.

**fantasypunk** is a game of made-up stories and heroic fantasy. Everyone playing pretends they are someone else in someplace else, somewhere filled with magic, fantastic beings and otherworldly horizons. Some people create problems and some people solve those problems, and many times, both are the same people. Hopefully, everyone playing will be right in the thick of it.

As you play, you take part in a conversation.

Conversations vary in so many ways. People talk and listen, sometimes one after the other and other times everyone at the same time, and sometimes nobody feels like they have something to say.

What is important is that a conversation makes sense when everyone taking part in it is having a good time and is feeling welcome, heard and boundaries are cared for.

Just like in a regular conversation, there are many questions to ask. In this conversation, though, the answers depend a little on what you know and a lot on what you can come up with on the spot.

But this game has a lot of things to help you have ideas because coming up with stuff on the spot is hard if you have to do a lot of it for a long time.

That’s why this game has a bunch of text divided into instructions, rules, prompts and guidance.

# Preparations

We need things, time and people to play **fantasypunk.** We also need to establish expectations and boundaries.

The ideal number of players ranges from 3 to 6. It doesn’t matter if you are playing over an online call or in-person for that. It’s possible for only 2 people to play, as well as more than 6 people, although I don’t recommend a very large group playing all at once.

A single, solo player could play too. But you will need to make a few accommodations as this game does not include guidance for solo play yet.

One of the players will play as the Giramundo, or GM, while the remaining players take the roles of Party Members. When the game refers to the Party, Party Members or Characters, we are talking about everyone who’s not the GM.

The necessary materials include writing and recording implements to keep the character sheets and adventure notes, and some six-sided dice, which we call d6 in this game. You can use physical or digital materials, in any combination.

Then we need time. Two to four hours is a reasonable amount of playtime, with plenty of breaks and snacks. It’s quite possible to play longer sessions, especially if the group is larger, or shorter sessions, especially if the group is smaller.

Finally, we need to set expectations for the game and to set boundaries for safe, accessible and welcoming play.

There is a whole chapter in **fantasypunk** that covers safety tools, at least superficially. But it includes links for you to make further research on your own.

<aside>
📍 Safety is a group responsibility and shouldn’t fall upon the shoulders of any individual player alone. 
It may be that the player hosting the game takes it upon themselves to have more responsibilities than the others, but that doesn’t mean they are supposed to do it all by themselves.

</aside>

**In a shortlist you need:**

- a player to be the GM and others to play the Party;
- writing and recording implements, physical or digital, to keep the character sheets and play notes;
- some six-sided dice, hopefully, a bunch of them per player, but in a pinch, only one will do;
- about two to four hours to play, maybe more, maybe less depending on group size;
- a choice of safety tools to be discussed among the players in the group.

# Pillars, Agenda and Principles

These are the first guidelines to help you play the game as it was intended. Stick close to them if you are a beginner and you will be fine.

Whether you’ve never played a role-playing game before or you have played many, look at this section to understand what sort of worlds and adventures you can hope to have at first.

When you’re not sure what to do, or you run out of ideas, come back here to help you figure out what to do next.

Keep in mind that these guidelines are assumptions, and expectations, not hard, unbreakable rules. The more you play, the easier it gets to play with or around them.

The GM has a specific set of principles and agenda that differ a little from this, but we will get there.

## The Pillars of Play

When you play **fantasypunk**, these things are always true:

- The world is alive and vibrant, and it doesn't revolve around the party;
- Folk are complicated, conflicted and diverse, but are mostly kind and willing to help;
- Magic is wondrous and wild, even if commonplace;
- The gods are silent and distant, hardly, if ever, interfering in the affairs of mortals;
- No individuals, folk or cultures are single-minded, unilateral or exclusive;
- The real monsters are those who stand against happiness, love and the freedom of being.

## Agenda

- Play characters that feel real;
- Stir up trouble;
- Disrupt the status quo;
- Play to **Find Out What Happens**.

## Principles

- Be brave and embrace the fantastic;
- Make your character fallible and relatable;
- Give your characters something to believe in;
- Address the party, not the players;
- Remind us of your moves;
- Take risks and embrace the consequences;
- Always ask questions. Always answer questions;
- Help everyone else get the spotlight...
- ... but shine on when you have it.

# Playing the Game

The game effectively begins with the group deciding about the kind of adventure all of you want to have, and what safety tools the group is most comfortable with.

The next step is creating a Party, which involves answering a few questions, as a group and individually.

Then creating the individual player characters, or Party Members, which is a simple process composed of a few steps.

Once everyone is ready, create the starting point of the adventure. All players, Party and GM, get to have a say here. If the group is feeling adventurous, then pick the Themes and Domains at random by rolling dice.

<aside>
🎲 Create a location by choosing 2 Themes and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain. Name the location.

</aside>

<aside>
📍 You can use a different procedure or an altogether different game to create a new location. There are a ton of great games such as [I’m sorry did you say street magic](https://seaexcursion.itch.io/street-magic), [Wanderhome](https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/wanderhome), [Awen](https://levikornelsen.itch.io/awen), [Premise](https://randylubin.itch.io/premise-setting-character-plot), some [Alone Hacks](https://itch.io/c/1059591/azukails-alone-among-the-stars-hacks), and so on.

</aside>

# Party Concepts

> *Your party is your family, at least sorts of. You only hang out with these people because you want to and because it makes sense. You have come to rely on each other, even if uneasily.
Best of all, among yourselves, you all know you can be you, and that's something you can hardly find anywhere else.*
> 

Choosing a party concept does two things: it helps the group decide together what kind of adventures everyone is going for, and it connects the party members to the world through questions and prompts.

You don’t have to commit to any of the options below forever, or you don’t have to commit to them at all, creating your own party concepts instead.

<aside>
📖 Choose a party concept from the options below. This choice is not forever, after all, if you make enough of a mess, you might have to skip town. Or you might just help overthrow the local governing bodies or something of the like. Feel free to come up with your own.

</aside>

## Buffer

You are the defenders or protectors of the local folk. Someone figured that if something bad came, it better come for you first.

<aside>
📖 Choose the Buffer if you want to stick to a small region, such as a town, city or whatever form of social organisation that makes sense in the setting.

</aside>

- Who or what makes this job worth it so that you just don't bail without looking back?
- Whose privilege you're shielding with your own lives?
- Why is that threat exaggerated, misleading or flat unreal?

## Misfits

Even if you wanted to settle down, finding peace anywhere folk wouldn't just keep bothering you or giving weird looks is a challenge in itself.

<aside>
📖 Choose the Misfits if you want to travel around at ease and on your terms, focusing on the journey and exploration.

</aside>

- Why does banding together seem to be the least bad alternative?
- What do you tell yourselves as a reason why you bounce around the world and why is it only partially true?
- Why can't you go home, and why is that only partially true?

## Vagabonds

You did something terrible and you must stay on the road. Well, at least that's what people say about you.

<aside>
📖 Choose the Vagabons if you wish to interact with people and organisations and you want to feel bounce between local intrigue and perilous journey.

</aside>

- Why do you have a bad reputation, and how is it only partially untrue?
- Whose position do you threaten by being you?
- Whose imposition force you to be on the run?

# Creating a Character

Now is the time you will conceptualize what kind of adventurer you want to play. All you need to do is follow the instructions below and you will have a character ready to go in no time.

When you’re done, introduce your characters to each other, and ask each as many questions as you want about each other’s characters. The GM might have some specific questions too. Either way, give honest and forthcoming answers. 

It’s ok to not have a good answer or any answer at all too. You will learn more about your characters as you play.

## Identity

> *I never forget a name or a face. If I catch your name and your likeness, it’s forever. That is a really good thing to have going when there’s a lot of people that owe me money.*
> 

Every fantasy character has a cool, mysterious name and an even cooler presence.

Your name can be inspired by your favourite characters or personalities out there, or you can pick some random name generator, you can pick an interesting word such as Crow or Mischievous.

Your presence is a basic description of your character, including looks, poise, or some other features.

Do what you want as long as you don't write anything racist, ableist or otherwise bigoted.

<aside>
📖 Come up with a name, pronouns and a brief description of your character's presence.
Tip: try using emotions or personality features, or avoiding colour words for aesthetics.

</aside>

## Origins

> *So you are an adventurer? And what life did you lose before you were born into this one?*
> 

When fleshing out the world around you, your Origins will help the GM come up with the right questions or answers for your character.

<aside>
📖 Roll or choose your Origins on the table below, then write a short description of what it means.

</aside>

| Roll | Woe | Status | Occupation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Exiled | Rebellious | Soldier |
| 2 | Runaway | Guild | Socialite |
| 3 | Ruined | Official | Artist |
| 4 | Lost | Court | Researcher |
| 5 | Wanted | Community | Aide |
| 6 | Infamous | Lead | Mage |

<aside>
🎲 **Knack**

Spend 1 Hold to ask the GM a question about what your character should know or should be able to do based on your Background.

</aside>

## Heritage Tags

> *All people are unique, see? There's the one who sees in the dark like a cat and the other with a tail like a monkey's. And then there's Jenna. It's pretty handy to go into the dark forgotten places of the world with someone who glows like a candle.*
> 

Heritage Tags allow you to do things most others can't, such as seeing in the dark, climbing a wall with your bare hands or gliding through the air with vestigial wings. 

Heritage Tags are noticeable by others.

<aside>
📖 Roll or choose 2 Heritage Tags on the table below. Alternatively, you can come up with your own.

1. Infravision Sight
2. Badger Claws
3. Strength of Two
4. Stone Skin
5. Luminous Aura
6. Translucent Body
</aside>

<aside>
🎲 **Boon and Bane**

Once per session, you can use a Boon and a Bane.

**Boon**: Turn a 5 or below into a 6. Describe which Tag helps you succeed.

**Bane**: Turn a 4 or higher into a 3. Describe which Tag is hindering you and clear and recover 1 Hold.

</aside>

## Traits

> *It's all about the right approach, you see? There are plenty of times to be nice and kind, and plenty of other times when you gotta kick the doors open.*
> 

As you navigate the world, you engage its peoples, its problems and its solutions through five traits:

- **Kind**: when you approach the world gently and with understanding;
- **Brave**: when you approach the world with courage and boldness;
- **Curious**: when you approach the world by observing and learning;
- **Precise**: When you approach the world with mastery and knowledge;
- **Insightful**: when you approach the world through its subtle veils.

<aside>
📖 Choose a trait to Highlight and a trait to Suppress.

</aside>

<aside>
🎲 A **Highlighted Trait** adds 2d6 to your dice pool. A **Suppressed Trait** adds none. The others add 1d6.

</aside>

<aside>
🎲 **Rolling dice**: take all of the dice provided by your Traits, Baggage or other things and roll them all at once. Keep the two highest dice and add them together.
Critical Hit: if the result is a 12, it’s a critical hit;
Solid Hit: if the result is 10 or above, it’s a solid hit;
Messy Hit: if the result is 7, 8 or 9, it’s a messy hit;
Miss: if the result is 6 or below, it’s a miss.

</aside>

## Baggage

> *I thought that wand of yours was just for show. Good thing those goons thought so too.*
> 

Baggage represents the relevant things you carry with you, material and otherwise, such as your Principles, a Sword, or Cunning.

As you adventure and face challenges, you may take harm from a battle, be frustrated by an obstacle or feel lost, weakened and beat up by many adversities, causing you to lose Hold of these very things you've come to rely on.

<aside>
📖 Write down 5 things to create your Baggage: something that you wield, wear, seek, fear and hide. Give each item 3 Hold.

</aside>

<aside>
🎲 When you make a roll, you may choose an item from your Baggage to rely on.

Add one die to the pool per Hold, then cross 1 Hold, unless you roll a critical hit.

Erase an item from your baggage to recover 3 Hold to the other items.

When you cross out all Aspects across all of your Baggage, you become Crushed.

When you erase all items from your Baggage, you become Unburdened.

</aside>

## Bonds & Debts

> *Ach! Fine! But if I help you this time, you better come at the drop of a hat when I need you, you hear me?*
> 

<aside>
📖 Create a Bond with an NPC and a Debt with another, then create a Bond with the player to your left (when in person) or below your name (when online).

</aside>

<aside>
🎲 To track down Bonds and Debts, write down the name of the character the new connection is with and a sentence describing the bond or debt. 
Deepening a bond or a debt adds another sentence to it, and paying off either asks the player to erase a sentence.

</aside>

## **Moves**

> *I wish I could swing a sword like you. People give you a wide berth when they realise you have no idea what you’re doing.*
> 

Moves are special ways to engage the fiction. Most of them require rolling dice, paying a price, or both. To make a move, just make a move. And when you make a move, you make the move.

Essentially, there are two types of Moves: Basic Moves, which are available to all players, and Special Moves, which each player chooses from the options available to refine their characters.

<aside>
📖 Choose 3 Special Moves.

</aside>

# Basic Moves

These moves are available to all party members at all times.

# Expression Moves

<aside>
📍 Currently this section of the text assumes that you have more familiarity with TTRPGs than other parts of the game.

</aside>

When you express your thoughts, feelings and actions, most of the time you do that through an expression move.

When you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Precise or Insightful, take 1d6. If you express a trait that is Highlighted, take 2d6 instead. If that trait is suppressed, take 1d6 instead.

You can only roll for a move if you have at least 2d6. So if you need more dice, you might need to rely on your Baggage or Push Your Luck. 

When a specialized move asks you to be Kind, Brave, Curious, Precise or Insightful, roll as many d6 as established and continue following that move’s instructions.

Expression Moves are open-ended, which means you must decide what you wish to do and how you approach that choice. Discuss with the GM and the rest of the Party whether you wish to interact with the world fictionally, mechanically or both, and then roll.

### When should you make these moves?

Expression moves cover a very wide array of actions, so it is tempting to make these moves and roll the dice every time.

On the other hand, there’s plenty that your characters should know or be able to do as second nature, without even thinking about it.

When you need to make an Expression Move, ask the GM and the rest of the party the questions below:

- Is the task at hand out of your depth, mastery or background?
- Are you under the pressure of time or something else as you do it?
- Do you lack a crucial tool, resource or information to do it?

If your answer was **no** to all questions, you don’t need to make the move. Discuss with the GM and your party members how you do the thing you want to.

If your answer was **no** to two questions, make your move and take +1d6 to your roll.

If your answer was **no** to one question, make your move as written.

If you answered **yes** to all questions, discuss with the group whether you should be able to make that move at all.

## Be Kind

**When you are kind**, ask the GM or another player what their character, a place or another entity needs. Ask yourself how you could fulfil that need, then roll Kind.

Decide how you are interacting with the fiction, with the game mechanics, or both, and discuss it with the GM and the rest of the Party.

On a solid hit, choose two keys. On a messy hit choose one. On a miss, brace yourself.

Keys: heal, treat, aid, relate, bond, deescalate, trust, inspire, support, sway, disarm.

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome;

## Be Brave

**When you are brave**, describe how you stand against wrong or harm to yourself or to others.

Decide how you are interacting with the fiction, with the game mechanics, or both, and discuss it with the GM and the rest of the Party.

On a solid hit, choose two keys. On a messy hit choose one. On a miss, brace yourself.

Keys: defend, protect, face against, stand against, seize, oppose, react, divert, boldness, daring;

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome.

## Be Precise

**When you are precise**, take stock of your preparation and resourcefulness to find the way.

Decide how you are interacting with the fiction, with the game mechanics, or both, and discuss it with the GM and the rest of the Party.

On a solid hit, choose two keys. On a messy hit choose one. On a miss, brace yourself.

Keys: fix, persuade, tweak, disarm, prepare, plan, expect, position, resources, divert.

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome.

## Be Curious

**When you are curious**, tell the other players and the GM what you wish to know more about.

Decide how you are interacting with the fiction, with the game mechanics, or both, and discuss it with the GM and the rest of the Party.

On a solid hit, choose two keys. On a messy hit choose one. On a miss, brace yourself.

Keys: path, threat, opportunity, safety, secret, seek, question.

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome.

## Be Insightful

**When you are insightful**, open your senses to the wondrous and otherworldly.

Decide how you are interacting with the fiction, with the game mechanics, or both, and discuss it with the GM and the rest of the Party.

On a solid hit, choose two keys. On a messy hit choose one. On a miss, brace yourself.

Keys: Sense, feel, wonder, attune, mystery, marvel, portent, presage, hunch, sign.

Describe how the keys you picked factor in the outcome.

# Baggage Moves

## Gain and Lose Hold

When you **lose Hold** erase as many Hold points as established from an appropriate item in your Baggage. 

When you **gain Hold** add as many Hold points as established to an appropriate item in your Baggage. 

When you lose all Hold in any item, that item becomes a Burden until you shed it or until it regains Hold.

## Shed a Burden

When you **shed a burden**, describe how you break, damage, give up or otherwise lose an item from your baggage and erase it. You recover 3 Hold to distribute however you want among the remaining items.

## Lose Baggage

When you **lose an item from your baggage** as a trade-off of a choice, a consequence of something you did, or something that hit you, erase it from your Baggage. You lose any Hold it still had.

## Crushed

When you **are crushed by the weight of your Burdens**, answer the questions below:

## Unburdened

When you **shed all of your burdens and lose all of your baggage**, you are unburdened.

# Auxiliary Moves

## Struggle

When you **struggle** **to avoid badness**, tell the party and the GM what consequence you intend to lessen or avoid, and agree with the others how it should happen. Then erase an item from your Baggage.

## Push Your Luck

When you push your luck, answer the questions below:

Is it worth more obligations? (Gain an Obligation);

Is it worth harm or loss to myself? (Lose 1 Hold or all bonus ongoing or forward);

Is it worth messing with fate? (You get -1d6 ongoing until the end of the session when you trust fate);

Roll between 1d6 for every question you answered yes.

Check your results against the move you made. Regardless of whether you hit or miss, for every dice result of 1 you choose a consequence from the questions you answered yes to.

## Trust Fate

When you **trust fate** to get you where you’re supposed to go, roll 2d6.

## Brace Yourself

When you **brace yourself**, the GM will make a move against you, as hard and they want. If you want to avoid badness, you can **Struggle.**

## Offer Help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you bear the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## Get in the way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

If they say yes, they choose one. If they say no, you choose one.

- Write an obligation to them;
- You lose 1 Hold.

If you give them no choice, then you take both.

## Team Work

When the party faces a Challenge as a group, agree on a party member to be the Lead and a party member to be the Support. They can both be the same. 

The Lead chooses a Trait to roll and each other party member joining the effort adds 1d6 to the pool. Anyone can add an additional 1d6 to the pool for every 1 Hold they spend.

Declare what Angle you wish to address and roll your Team Work.

On a solid hit, you cross that Angle out. Describe how and celebrate your success.

On a messy hit, the team takes -1d6 forward, unless the support chooses to take -1d6 ongoing.

On a miss, brace yourselves. Everyone involved shares the outcome and the support takes the brunt of the badness.

## Yield

When the party **yields** before or during a conflict with otherwise reasonable foes, ask questions from **Read the Room** or **Read a Person** as if you had rolled a sound hit.

As a group, tell the GM what could happen to you all and agree upon a fun and satisfying outcome.

# Exploration Moves

When travelling through the world, you enter the Exploration phase. You can use these moves when exploring.

## Prepare

When you prepare for the journey ahead, be Precise.

## Set Out

When you set out into the wilds, ask each party member for 1 hope they have for the road ahead and 1 fear. Also, answer these 3 questions:

- Is the group stocked up?
- Is the group free of duress or any injury that may inhibit their journey?
- Has the group eluded dangerous attention in the area?

One party member rolls 1d6 for every time the group could answer yes to the above questions. 

On a solid hit, the GM chooses 2 hopes to be realized along the way. On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 hope and 1 fear to be realized. On a miss, The GM chooses 2 fears to be realized, this is going to be a long journey.

## Arrive

When you arrive at a new location, choose 2 Themes for that location and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain. 

If that place is a landmark, settlement or otherwise remarkable place, you may name it.

## Delve

When you guide the party through a dangerous or unfamiliar place, roll Curious. 

On a hit, gain 1 token. On a sound hit choose 2 from below. On a messy hit choose 1:

- This area contains something valuable or useful;
- This area’s residents are not immediately hostile;
- You find a clue to the true nature of this place or an important insight about its denizens.

Spend 1 token to Return to an area you’ve visited before Spend 3 tokens to find the heart of the area, or locate someone or something you are attempting to track down.

## Catch your Breath

When you **catch your breath** during exploration, each party member describes 1 risk of resting here.

You get as many tokens as the dice you rolled.

Any party member can spend these tokens to do the following:

- Recover 3 Hold;
- Recover a Burden you crossed out;
- Recover a spent Heritage Tag use.

For this move, lower results are more desirable. 

On a result of 1 to 3, your rest is uneventful.

On a roll of 4 or 5, the GM chooses a risk and it comes to pass.

On a roll of 6, the GM chooses two risks to come to pass.

# Obligation Moves

## Gain an Obligation

When you gain an Obligation, write the name of the person, place or entity you owe this Obligation to, and a sentence that describes it.

If that Obligation has a condition that may render it impossible to fulfil, mention it in its description, or in your notes somewhere else.

If that obligation has any sort of time or resource constraint, start an appropriate clock.

If the clock runs out or if you render it impossible to fulfil, brace yourself.

## Clear an Obligation

When you clear an Obligation by meeting its terms, fulfilling it or if you are released from it, write how you cleared it below or instead of its description.

# Downtime Moves

On a sound hit, they mark XP if they do what you want, and if they don't, they must reveal how you could convince them. On a messy hit, they mark XP if they do what you want (but can refuse or make a counter-offer if they like).

**For the other folk:** If they have reason to resist, roll Kind: on a sound hit, they either do as you want or reveal the easiest way to convince them. On a messy hit, they reveal something you can do to convince them, though it’ll likely be costly, tricky, or distasteful.

- the effect you desire comes to pass;
- you retain control;

On a solid hit, the GM gives you good detail. On a messy hit, the GM gives you an impression. If you already know all there is to know, the GM will tell you that.

### ☐ Shape Change

**Scatter track: ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐**

You can transform into an animal that you have studied extensively, and back again. While in this form, your inventory is a list of that animal's natural features.

Choose two tags for that animal, replacing your own personal tags while you're in its shape.

Scatter: When you spend long periods of time in animal shape, or when you endure stress, exhaustion or harm, you start to forget how much of you is you and how much of you is the animal, until you forget completely.

- Gain 1 scatter when you spend a whole shift in animal form;
- Gain 1 scatter when you take a serious Blow;
- Gain 1 scatter when you lose all Hold on a burden;
- Gain 1 scatter when you erase a burden.

At 3 scatter you need help to regain your true form. At 5 scatter you become an animal and even if you are turned back by someone powerful enough to revert your condition, it changes you. Erase one of your personal tags and replace it with another.

### ☐ Summon Elements

On a miss, brace yourself.

### ☐ Chanter's Lore

# Themes and Domains

# Challenges

Sometimes problems require more than a simple, direct approach.

Challenges represent contests, conflict, or complex obstacles that will put the party through the gauntlet.

The prosecutor at a trial, a group of armed soldiers, a troll in the middle of a bridge, children playing tag or a dragon raining fire down on the party are all examples of Challenges.

## Creating a Challenge

1. Determine the nature of the Challenge the party will face. 
    
    Examples:
    
    - A debate with the High Magistrate;
    - Traversing a room warded by Magic Sigils;
    - Battling a Fiery Dragon.
2. Define what Angles that Challenge has.
    
    An Angle is a word or short phrase that describes what advantages or actions a Challenge can leverage against the Party.
    
    The more Angles a Challenge has, the harder it is to overcome it.
    
    Look at these examples of Challenges. These are not all of the possible types of challenges, only a few more or less obvious situations.
    
    <aside>
    🔖 Scocial Challenge: **The High Magistrate**

3. Create custom GM moves and tags.

    - **Dragon Fire**: The dragon's fire causes a magical burn that causes otherworldly pain and can only be fully healed with special magic.
    </aside>
    

## Overcoming Challenges

Overcoming a Challenge doesn't mean necessarily overcoming each and all of its Angles, as the fiction changes every time the party overcomes an Angle.

For example: by overcoming the Fiery Dragon's Cunning, the dragon will change tactics to a more direct and dangerous approach, which could mean that the characters now have more opportunities against it, but may also mean that the dragon will hit more recklessly.

Some Challenges might be overcome by defeating only some of its Angles.

For example: by defusing the Illusion Magic and the Trapped Control Pannel, the characters might be able to punch a command that will allow them to move forward before the Sigils go off.

Maybe by pursuing complete defeat of the Challenge, the party might earn a greater benefit, while the overall cost might be higher as a downside.

## Clocks

![A set of four clocks, each one a circle divided in 4, 6, 8 and 6 segments, respectively. The last clock has two segments painted.](the%20Guide%20and%20Mediator%207e85fe273de642288314b0af17e1dccb/clocks-black.png)

A set of four clocks, each one a circle divided in 4, 6, 8 and 6 segments, respectively. The last clock has two segments painted.

Clocks are a way of keeping track of events and action that happens in the background. While not literal timepieces, they make the world feel as though it is moving even if the players are not.

Divide a circle into sections as needed. Start it full, empty or halfway. Tick it up or down as events occur, and trigger new events when it fills or empties. Track things like resources, situations, travel, threats, hunger, XP, etc.

 Some clocks are visible to everyone, others are hidden since the players may not know about everything that happens in the world.

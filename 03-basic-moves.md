# Basic Moves

These moves are available to all party members at all times. 

# Expression Moves

<aside>
üìç Currently this section of the text assumes that you have more familiarity with TTRPGs than other parts of the game.

</aside>

When you express your thoughts, feelings and actions, most of the time you do that through an expression move.

When you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Precise or Insightful, take 1d6. If you express a trait that is Highlighted, take 2d6 instead. If that trait is suppressed, take 1d6 instead.

You can only roll for a move if you have at least 2d6. So if you need more dice, you might need to rely on your Baggage or Push Your Luck. 

When a specialized move asks you to be Kind, Brave, Curious, Precise or Insightful, roll as many d6 as established and continue following that move‚Äôs instructions.

Expression Moves are open-ended, which means you must decide what you wish to do and how you approach that choice. Discuss with the GM and the rest of the Party whether you wish to interact with the world fictionally, mechanically or both, and then roll.

### When should you make these moves?

Expression moves cover a very wide array of actions, so it is tempting to make these moves and roll the dice every time.

On the other hand, there‚Äôs plenty that your characters should know or be able to do as second nature, without even thinking about it.

When you need to make an Expression Move, ask the GM and the rest of the party the questions below:

- Is the task at hand out of your depth, mastery or background?
- Are you under the pressure of time or something else as you do it?
- Do you lack a crucial tool, resource or information to do it?

If your answer was **no** to all questions, you don‚Äôt need to make the move. Discuss with the GM and your party members how you do the thing you want to.

If your answer was **no** to two questions, make your move and take +1d6 to your roll.

If your answer was **no** to one question, make your move as written.

If you answered **yes** to all questions, discuss with the group whether you should be able to make that move at all.

## Be Kind

**When you are kind**, ask the GM or another player what their character, a place or another entity needs. Ask yourself how you could fulfil that need, then roll Kind.

When you lose all Hold in any item, that item becomes a Burden until you shed it or until it regains Hold.

## Shed a Burden

## Lose Baggage

When you **lose an item from your baggage** as a trade-off of a choice, a consequence of something you did, or something that hit you, erase it from your Baggage. You lose any Hold it still had.

## Overwhelmed

When you **are overwhelmed by your Burdens**, choose one:

- You lose something precious (erase an item from your Baggage);
- You become callous and distant (suppress Kind);
- You are thoroughly disheartened (suppress Brave);
- Your spirit is broken (suppress Curious);
- You are shaken and unfocused (suppress Precise);
- Your senses are dulled and rough (suppress Insightful).

## Unburdened

When you **shed all of your burdens and lose all of your baggage**, you are unburdened.

As you set yourself free from your baggage, choose whether you **Retire** or whether you **Change**.

Retire:

- Retire this character and answer one of the questions below:
- Do you find yourself unable to carry on? Why?
- Do you die? How?
- Are you somehow removed to another place, literally or not, so that you cannot stay with the party for an indeterminate time? Where?

Change:

- Something you: must recover, must give up, must understand anew;

# Auxiliary Moves

## Struggle

When you **struggle** **to avoid badness**, tell the party and the GM what consequence you intend to lessen or avoid, and agree with the others how it should happen. Then erase an item from your Baggage.

## Push Your Luck

When you push your luck, answer the questions below:

Is it worth more obligations? (Gain an Obligation);

Is it worth harm or loss to myself? (Lose 1 Hold or all bonus ongoing and forward);

Is it worth messing with fate? (You get -1d6 ongoing until the end of the session when you Trust Fate);

Roll between 1d6 for every question you answered yes.

Check your results against the move you made. Regardless of whether you hit or miss, for every dice result of 1 you choose a consequence from the questions you answered yes to.

## Trust Fate

When you **trust fate** to get you where you‚Äôre supposed to go, roll 2d6.

## Brace Yourself

When you **brace yourself**, the GM will make a move against you, as hard as they see fit. If you want to avoid badness, you can **Struggle.**

## Offer Help

When you offer help to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you bear the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## Get in the way

When you get in the way of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

If they say yes, they choose one. If they say no, you choose one.

- Write an obligation to them;
- You lose 1 Hold.

If you give them no choice, then you take both.

## Team Work

When the party faces a Challenge as a group, agree on a party member to be the Lead and a party member to be the Support. They can both be the same. 

The Lead chooses a Trait to roll and each other party member joining the effort adds 1d6 to the pool. Anyone can add an additional 1d6 to the pool for every 1 Hold they spend.

Declare what Angle you wish to address and roll your Team Work.

On a hit, that Angle loses 1 Edge.

On a critical hit, you cross that Angle out. Describe how and celebrate your success.

On a messy hit, the team takes -1d6 forward to engage the Challenge, unless the support chooses to take -1d6 ongoing to engage the Challenge. 

On a miss, brace yourselves. Everyone involved shares the outcome and the support takes the brunt of the badness.

## Yield

When the party **yields** before or during a conflict with otherwise reasonable foes, ask questions from **Read the Room** or **Read a Person** as if you had rolled a sound hit.

As a group, tell the GM what could happen to you all and agree upon a fun and satisfying outcome.

# Exploration Moves

When travelling through the world, you enter the Exploration phase. You can use these moves when exploring.

## Prepare

When you prepare for the journey ahead, be Precise.

## Set Out

When you set out into the wilds, ask each party member for 1 hope they have for the road ahead and 1 fear. Also, answer these 3 questions:

- Is the group stocked up?
- Is the group free of duress or any injury that may inhibit their journey?
- Has the group eluded dangerous attention in the area?

One party member rolls 1d6 for every time the group could answer yes to the above questions. 

On a solid hit, the GM chooses 2 hopes to be realized along the way. On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 hope and 1 fear to be realized. On a miss, The GM chooses 2 fears to be realized, this is going to be a long journey.

## Roam

When the party **roams** the world without a specific goal or destiny, roll 2d6. Use the lowest die to pick a Theme and the other to pick a Domain, then do it a second time to pick a second Theme and a second Domain.

## Arrive

When you arrive at a new location, choose 2 Themes for that location and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain. 

If that place is a landmark, settlement or otherwise remarkable place, you may name it.

## Delve

When you guide the party through a dangerous or unfamiliar place, roll Curious. 

On a hit, gain 1 token. On a sound hit choose 2 from below. On a messy hit choose 1:

- This area contains something valuable or useful;
- This area‚Äôs residents are not immediately hostile;
- You find a clue to the true nature of this place or an important insight about its denizens.

Spend 1 token to Return to an area you‚Äôve visited before Spend 3 tokens to find the heart of the area, or locate someone or something you are attempting to track down.

## Catch your Breath

When you **catch your breath** during exploration, each party member describes 1 risk of resting here.

You get as many tokens as the dice you rolled.

Any party member can spend these tokens to do the following:

- Recover 3 Hold;
- Recover a Burden you crossed out;
- Recover a spent Heritage Tag use.

For this move, lower results are more desirable. 

On a result of 1 to 3, your rest is uneventful.

On a roll of 4 or 5, the GM chooses a risk and it comes to pass.

On a roll of 6, the GM chooses two risks to come to pass.

# Obligation Moves

## Gain an Obligation

When you gain an Obligation, write the name of the person, place or entity you owe this Obligation to, and a sentence that describes it.

If that Obligation has a condition that may render it impossible to fulfil, mention it in its description, or in your notes somewhere else.

If that obligation has any sort of time or resource constraint, start an appropriate clock.

If the clock runs out or if you render it impossible to fulfil, brace yourself.

## Clear an Obligation

When you clear an Obligation by meeting its terms, fulfilling it or if you are released from it, write how you cleared it below or instead of its description.

# Basic Moves

These moves are available to all party members at all times.

# Expression Moves

> üìç Currently this section of the text assumes that you have more familiarity with TTRPGs than other parts of the game.

When you express your thoughts, feelings and actions, most of the time you do that through an expression move.

When you are Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, take 1d6. If you express a trait that is Highlighted, take 2d6 instead. If that trait is suppressed, take 1d6 instead.

You can only roll for a move if you have at least 2d6. So if you need more dice, you might need to rely on your Baggage or Push Your Luck.

When a specialized move asks you to be Kind, Brave, Curious, Mindful or Insightful, roll as many d6 as established and continue following that move‚Äôs instructions.

Expression Moves are open-ended, which means you must decide what you wish to do and how you approach that choice. Discuss with the GM and the rest of the Party whether you wish to interact with the world fictionally, mechanically or both, and then roll.

> Tip - Mechanics you could interact with: a clock, an angle, a burden, an obligation, a debt, the dice.

### When should you make these moves?

Expression moves cover a very wide array of actions, so it is tempting to make these moves and roll the dice every time.

On the other hand, there‚Äôs plenty that your characters should know or be able to do as second nature, without even thinking about it.

When you need to make an Expression Move, discuss with the party and the GM which of these statements you believe are true.

- I have enought practice or experience at this I don't need to think about it.
- I have time and freedom to do it leisurely.
- I am empowered or supplied by the knowledge and tools necessary.

If all statements are true, you should be able to do what you set out to without a roll. Discuss with the GM and your party members how you do the thing you want to.

If two statements are true, take +1d6 forward.

If one statement is true, make your move and roll the dice as usual.

If none of these statements are true, discuss with the group whether you should be able to make that move at all.

## Add or Drop Weight

When you **add Weight**, add as many Weight points as established to an appropriate item in your Baggage.

When you **drop Weight**, remove as many Weight points as established from an appropriate item in your Baggage.

As long as you have 3 Weight on any single item in your Baggage, it is a Burden, and you can't rely on it anymore.

## Alternative move concept: Find Release

when you find release, look at your core values

add one and/or change one

# Auxiliary Moves

## Trust Fate

When you **trust fate** to get you where you‚Äôre supposed to go, roll 2d6.

## Struggle

When you **struggle to avoid badness**, tell the party and the GM what consequence you intend to lessen or avoid, and agree with the others how it should happen. Then **give up** an item from your Baggage.

## Push Your Luck

When you push your luck, answer the questions below:

Is it worth more obligations? (Gain an Obligation);

Is it worth harm or loss to myself? (Add 1 Weight or lose all bonus ongoing and forward);

Is it worth messing with fate? (You get -1d6 ongoing until the end of the session when you Trust Fate);

Roll 1d6 for every question you answered yes.

Check your results against the move you made. Regardless of whether you hit or miss, for every dice result of 1 you choose a consequence implied by the questions you answered yes to.


## Brace Yourself

When you **brace yourself**, the GM will make a move against you, as hard as they see fit. If you want to avoid badness, you can **Struggle.**

## Offer Help

When you **offer help** to a party member and they accept, add +1d6 to their dice pool. Both of you bear the consequences and mishaps of a messy hit or a miss.

## Get in the way

When you **get in the way** of a party member, you can give them a choice. Ask them whether they fail because of you.

If they say yes, they choose one. If they say no, you choose one.

- Write an obligation to them;
- You add 1 Weight.

If you give them no choice, then you take both.

## Team Work

When the party faces a Challenge as a group, agree on a party member to be the Lead and a party member to be the Support. They can both be the same.

When the Lead makes a roll, each other party member joining the effort adds 1d6 to the pool. Anyone can add an additional 1d6 to the pool for every 1 Weight they add.

Declare what Angle you wish to address and roll your Team Work.

On a hit, that Angle loses 1 Edge.

On a critical hit, you cross that Angle out. Describe how and celebrate your success.

On a messy hit, the team takes -1d6 forward to engage the Challenge, unless the support chooses to take -1d6 ongoing to engage the Challenge.

On a miss, brace yourselves. Everyone involved shares the outcome and the support takes the brunt of the badness.

## Yield

When the party **yields** before or during a conflict with otherwise reasonable foes, ask questions from **Read the Room** or **Read a Person** as if you had rolled a sound hit.

As a group, tell the GM what could happen to you all and agree upon a fun and satisfying outcome.

# Exploration Moves

When travelling through the world, you enter the Exploration phase. You can use these moves when exploring.

## Prepare

When you prepare for the journey ahead, be Mindful.

## Set Out

When you set out into the wilds, ask each party member for 1 hope they have for the road ahead and 1 fear. Also, answer these 3 questions:

- Is the group stocked up?
- Is the group free of duress or any injury that may inhibit their journey?
- Has the group eluded dangerous attention in the area?

One party member rolls 1d6 for every time the group could answer yes to the above questions.

On a solid hit, the GM chooses 2 hopes to be realized along the way. On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 hope and 1 fear to be realized. On a miss, The GM chooses 2 fears to be realized, this is going to be a long journey.

## Roam

When the party **roams** the world without a specific goal or destiny, roll 2d6. Use the lowest die to pick a Theme and the other to pick a Domain, then do it a second time to pick a second Theme and a second Domain.

## Arrive

When you arrive at a new location, choose 2 Themes for that location and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain.

If that place is a landmark, settlement or otherwise remarkable place, you may name it.

## Delve

When you guide the party through a dangerous or unfamiliar place, roll Curious.

On a hit, gain 1 token. On a sound hit choose 2 from below. On a messy hit choose 1:

- This area contains something valuable or useful;
- This area‚Äôs residents are not immediately hostile;
- You find a clue to the true nature of this place or an important insight about its denizens.

Spend 1 token to Return to an area you‚Äôve visited before Spend 3 tokens to find the heart of the area, or locate someone or something you are attempting to track down.

idea: the area tells history (maybe myriad hex tyle?)

## Catch your Breath

When you **catch your breath** during exploration, each party member describes 1 risk of resting here.

You get as many tokens as the dice you rolled.

Any party member can spend these tokens to do the following:

- Let go of 3 Weight;
- Recover a spent Heritage Tag use.

For this move, lower results are more desirable.

On a result of 1 to 3, your rest is uneventful.

On a roll of 4 or 5, the GM chooses a risk and it comes to pass.

On a roll of 6, the GM chooses two risks to come to pass.

# Obligation Moves

## Gain an Obligation

When you gain an Obligation, write the name of the person, place or entity you owe this Obligation to, and a sentence that describes it.

If that Obligation has a condition that may render it impossible to fulfil, mention it in its description, or in your notes somewhere else.

If that obligation has any sort of time or resource constraint, start an appropriate clock.

If the clock runs out or if you render it impossible to fulfil, **brace yourself**.

## Clear an Obligation

When you clear an Obligation by meeting its terms, fulfilling it or if you are released from it, write how you cleared it below or instead of its description.

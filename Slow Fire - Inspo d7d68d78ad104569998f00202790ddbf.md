<aside>
ðŸ“Ž Youâ€™re are leaving town together, escaping the law by car.

What crime did each of you commit? Why? What illegal thing

are you taking with you? Choose whether your car is rugged,

luxurious, or fast.

One of you pick a die and roll it:

1-3: Describe the landscape or town you are passing through.

Take a break. Roll again.

4: You damage the car. You must fix it.

5: Someone discovers your illegal thing. You must dissuade

her.

6: The police are after them. You must escape.

On a 4, 5, or 6, describe the situation and pass the die to

another player. She will say how you solve this problem. Then

she rolls the die, following the previous rules.

When a 4 comes out for the third time (or fourth, if the car is

rugged): It breaks, but you escape, low-key for a while.

When a 5 comes out for the third time (or fourth, if the car is

luxurious): A villager gives you away, and you end up in prison.

When a 6 comes out for the third time (or fourth, if the car is

fast): They catch up and slaughter you all.

For larger groups or longer games, add another box to the

counters and let the path guide you.

4 OOOO No fame

5 OOOO No freedom

6 OOOO No life

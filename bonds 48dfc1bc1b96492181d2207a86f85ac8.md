# bonds

Bonds are connections between your character and others.

You might have bonds with another player character, an NPC, a group or a community. Having a bond with someone signals that your relationship is important to the story.

You establish up to three bonds when you create your character, and develop more as you play. Each bond has four parts:

The name of the person or faction it is with

An emotion describing how you currently feel about them

A statement that shows the cause of those feelings

A number of stitches, representing its strength

Each rolebook also has their own collection of bond triggers

which strengthen bonds as you play.

Bonds are always two-way. If you want a bond with another

player character, they must have a bond with you. If you

have a bond with an NPC, they’ll be able to use that bond too.

Bonds are a shared resource that both sides of it can use.

WHO CAN I HAVE BONDS WITH?

While most of your bonds will be with other people, you

can also have bonds with supernatural beings like

Remnants and envoys, with pets, factions, communities,

groups, families or even concepts (see The Heart).

The main thing to consider is that bonds are always two

directional. They represent something that has some kind

of hold over you, too. It should be with something you can

make demands of and that can make demands of you.

13Each bond is defined by its emotions. Each side of the bond

will write down an emotion that represents how they feel

about their bond with the other.

This can be any emotion, it doesn’t have to be a named

emotion on your character sheet. Both sides of the bond can

choose a different emotion, they don’t have to match.

Levary creates a bond with sair Remnant, Oroloc. Sai

decide that sair emotion towards Oroloc is “reverence”.

The Fates also note Oroloc’s emotion towards Levary,

deciding that “disinterested” sums up their feelings at the

start of play.

Remember that these emotions will change as you play, they

aren’t set in stone. Pick whatever makes the most sense

right now, and you can alter things as you find out more

about your character and their relationships.

A bond statement is a short sentence that gives a little more

context about your bond. While the emotion sums up your

feelings towards the target of your bond, the statement gives

details about why you feel that way.

Like the emotion, the statement will shift as you play.

Good statements often work to give both a reason for your

bond, as well as some action to guide your roleplaying.

When you’re creating your bond, think about what your

character wants from the one they share it with. Do they

want to impress them? Teach them? Protect them?

Preserve their relationship?

Levary writes the statement “Oroloc is sacred and worthy

of my devotion. I will become their servant.”

Each bond has a strength. This represents how

tight the bond currently is; how connected the

two sides of the bond are. Bond strength is

represented by these stitches on the left.

The more stitches that are filled, the stronger the

bond. Bond strength often effects the the

outcomes of different moves—you might be able

to help someone better with a close bond than a fraying or

normal one.

Three stitches is a close bond.

Two stitches is a normal bond.

One stitch is a fraying bond.

A bond severs once it loses its last stitch.

The strength of a bond is shared by both sides of that bond.

Bond strength doesn’t necessarily represent any kind of

tenderness of feeling; it’s about how tied up you are in each

others lives.

Grouse feels angry towards his brother Pheasant, but their

bond is still close. They’re still tied up in each others lives.

If a bond severs, either the distance between you has grown

too vast, or there are tensions in your relationship that have

gone unresolved. You trigger sever which will offer both of

you choices about whether you try to repair your bond.

Bonds will shift regularly as you play, usually as the outcome

of a move. You might find a new closeness, or you might push

the edges of your relationship, risking something fraying or

changing.

14Through play, you’ll use bonds to trigger bond moves, such as

when you demand action from your bond, or help, hinder or

reassure them.

Bond moves will often instruct you to roll plus your bond’s

emotion. Whenever you’re working closely with the target of

your bond, those are the feelings that are coming up, whether

your character notices them or not.

Instead of choosing which emotion to roll with, you roll with

the emotion you have assigned to the bond (if this is not one

of your named emotions, use fabric in its place).

You can gain new bonds or replace old ones as you play. If you

strengthen a bond with someone you don’t already have a

bond with, you can create a bond with them.

When you gain a new bond with someone, it always starts at

strength normal. You can have as many bonds as you have

available bond slots.

If you have filled your bond slots, you can gain new slots

through advancement, or by clearing out filled bonds to make

room for new ones.

If you want to clear and replace a bond, the bond target gets

to choose what happens.

If they agree that the old bond is no longer important: erase

the bond and they’ll take an obligation on you.

If they want to keep the bond, you have a choice: keep the

bond as it is or trigger the bond move sever.

You might be

told to change a bond’s emotion or statement during play.

This represents a change in how you think about your bond.

It might be a big change or a small one.

Your relationship with the target of your bond is changing—

do you feel something different when you think of them? Do

you want something different from them?

Erase the old emotion and/or statement and record a new

one instead. Let everyone at the table know how your bond

has changed.

Obligations mark one-sided debts, and connections that

aren’t important enough to be bonds.

Obligations can be used in the place of a bond when

triggering a bond move. They are spent when you use them.

If you have multiple obligations on someone, you can spend

them together to make a bond move as if you had a stronger

bond—two obligations to equal a normal bond, three

obligations equal a strong bond.

Broh, an NPC, has been helping out Erit, a Tender, with his

farm, enough to have earned two obligations. When Broh

realises that she needs a cart to travel to a nearby village,

she decides to call those obligations in.

She uses them in place of a bond to make a demand. She

decides to use both bonds, getting to select two options

from the move. If Erit doesn’t repay Broh, others will know

of his refusal and she’ll gain advantage if she acts against

him—say, when she decides to just take the cart anyway.

# Moves

## Help

When you help someone you have a

bond with, say what aid you lend

and roll. On a success, pick 1 for

each stitch in your bond. On a 7-9,

they also choose 1: your bond is

weakened or one of you changes

your bond’s emotion or statement.

» They gain advantage

» They may roll with their bond

emotion

» You stitch emotions in their place

On a miss, you weaken your bond.

You may still pick 1 from above, but

if you do, you tie yourself to any

consequences they face.

## Demand Action

When you demand action from

someone you have a bond with, say

what you want them to do. Then,

for each stitch in your bond, pick 1

thing they’ll risk if they refuse:

» Their reputation. Others will

know of their refusal

» Your faith and trust. They’ll have

to weaken their bond with you

» Your retribution. You’ll gain

advantage forward against them

» A further debt. They’ll owe you an

obligation

They can do what you ask—

strengthening their bond with you

or gaining an obligation—or pay the

price of refusal.

## Hinder

When you hinder someone you have

a bond with, pick as many as you like

as they make their move,

weakening your bond for each:

» They gain disadvantage

» They stitch their emotion, even if

they don’t match

» They’ll face greater consequences

on a miss

Regardless, they may choose to

sever their bond with you. If they

don’t, they may choose to change

their bond’s emotion or statement.

## Reassure

When you reassure someone you

have a bond with, stitch an emotion,

then pick 1:

» You address how they’re feeling:

they remove a stitch from any of

their emotions

» You make them a promise: they

can strengthen their bond

» You give them encouragement:

they heal 1 light wear

## Sever

When your bond with someone is

severed, they say how that bond has

fractured or faded. If they wish,

they may tell you how you can make

amends.

Commit to repairing the bond,

holding it open until amends are

made, or erase it giving them

advantage ongoing against you
